# Webware Migration Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First
Every capability ships as a self-contained, independently testable library component. Components MUST have a clear, singular purpose; organizational-only or kitchen-sink packages are prohibited.

### II. Contracts First
This package is a contract package: it defines the interfaces and specialized types that consumers depend on. The migration runner, tracking-table management, and discovery belong in the mechanism layer or in consumers, never in this package. The canonical contract is `Webware\Migration\MigrationInterface` (`getVersion`, `getDescription`, `up`, `down`).

### III. Persistence & Bus Agnostic
Interfaces use natural PHP types only. No php-db result-set or row-prototype types and no message-bus types may cross package boundaries. This package stays free of message-bus imports.

### IV. Webware Quality Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every change MUST pass the shared webware gates: Mago format, lint, analyze, and guard with no silent suppression; PHPUnit 13 strict mode (coverage metadata, mock/stub split, `failOnNotice`/`failOnDeprecation`/`failOnWarning`); and Infection mutation coverage at or above the configured thresholds. Test doubles follow PHPUnit 13 rules — `createStub()` for value doubles, `createMock()` only with `expects()`.

### V. Naming & Compatibility
Class and interface names MUST NOT add redundant descriptive prefixes that repeat the enclosing namespace. Interface names end in `Interface`; trait names end in `Trait`. Support only current supported PHP versions (`~8.4.1 || ~8.5.0`). This package depends on `webware/webware-core` for shared contracts.

## Dependencies & Compatibility

- `webware/webware-core` is the sole runtime dependency, supplying shared contracts (e.g. `SchemaInterface`).
- `webware/webware-tools` is a development-only dependency supplying the shared Mago configuration and CI conventions.
- VCS repository entries appear only for pre-release dev dependencies and are removed once the dependency is tagged on Packagist.

## Development Workflow

- Spec-driven development: each step (constitution, specify, plan, tasks, implement, converge) lands as its own branch and squash-merged pull request.
- Commits use Conventional Commits and carry the maintainer's real identity (`Joey Smith <jsmith@webinertia.net>`).

## Governance

- This constitution supersedes other practices; conflicts are resolved in its favor or the constitution is amended via pull request.
- Amendments require a pull request that updates the version and Last Amended date.
- Every pull request is reviewed for compliance with the Core Principles.
